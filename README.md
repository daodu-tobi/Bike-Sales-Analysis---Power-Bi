- Bikes sales constitutes 73% of the total revenue that was generated

Recommendations

- United states and Australia generated 58% of the total revenue, a new strategy should be develop to increase demand for product in other countries so as to generate more revenue across those countries.

- Customers between the ages of 25-34 should be more targeted as they only account for 36% of the total revenue, more strategies should be used to reach customer within this age range.

- Clothing and bikes accessories only generated 27% of the total revenue, therfore, new strategy must be developed to increase demands of the categories of product.
